# ALFT: M4L1 - Warm Up

Your job is to classify these locations by which borough they're in.

1. Add **class attributes** to the list items. Each list item‘s class attribute should correspond to the borough it’s in. For instance, the first item might have the class `manhattan`, because Times Square is in Manhattan.

2. Write CSS that gives each borough its own unique style.

Make sure the class attributes you add to your HTML match the **class selectors** in the CSS exactly!
